## Overview

- Single-screen arcade-style game
- 3x3 fruit grid with random visibility every 500 ms
- 10-second countdown game loop
- Score tracking and replay dialog

## Modernized Tech Stack

- Kotlin (Android)
- Android Gradle Plugin 8.5.0
- Gradle 8.7
- Data Binding
- Material 3 theme
- ConstraintLayout + GridLayout

## Project Structure

- `app/src/main/java/com/halil/ozel/catchthefruits/MainActivity.kt` - game loop, score logic, timer, replay dialog
- `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml` - UI with Data Binding
- `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` - localized UI texts and formatted strings
- `app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml` - Material 3 app theme

## How the Game Works

1. Game starts with score `0` and time `10`.
2. Every 500 ms, all fruits hide and one random fruit is shown.
3. Tapping visible fruit increases score.
4. At the end of 10 seconds, game stops and replay dialog appears.
